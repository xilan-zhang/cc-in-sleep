# Research Review via Codex MCP (xhigh reasoning)

Get a multi-round critical review of research work from an external LLM with maximum reasoning depth.

## Context: $ARGUMENTS

## Prerequisites

- **Codex MCP Server** configured in Claude Code:
  ```bash
  claude mcp add codex -s user -- codex mcp-server
  ```
- This gives Claude Code access to `mcp__codex__codex` and `mcp__codex__codex-reply` tools

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Research Context
Before calling the external reviewer, compile a comprehensive briefing:
1. Read project narrative documents (e.g., STORY.md, README.md, paper drafts)
2. Read any memory/notes files for key findings and experiment history
3. Identify: core claims, methodology, key results, known weaknesses

### Step 2: Initial Review (Round 1)
Send a detailed prompt with xhigh reasoning:

```
mcp__codex__codex:
  config: {"model_reasoning_effort": "xhigh"}
  prompt: |
    [Full research context + specific questions]
    Please act as a senior Organization Theory / Strategy reviewer
    (ASQ, AMR, SMJ, Organization Science level). Identify:
    1. Theoretical gaps — is the mechanism well-specified and boundary conditions clear?
    2. Empirical concerns — identification strategy, endogeneity, alternative explanations
    3. Narrative and framing weaknesses — is the contribution positioned correctly in the literature?
    4. Whether the contribution is sufficient for a top management journal
    5. Missing robustness checks or supplementary analyses
    Please be brutally honest.
```

### Step 3: Iterative Dialogue (Rounds 2-N)
Use `mcp__codex__codex-reply` with the returned `threadId` to continue the conversation:

For each round:
1. **Respond** to criticisms with evidence/counterarguments
2. **Ask targeted follow-ups** on the most actionable points
3. **Request specific deliverables**: experiment designs, paper outlines, claims matrices

Key follow-up patterns:
- "If we reframe X as Y, does that change your assessment?"
- "What's the minimum analysis/robustness check to satisfy concern Z?"
- "Please design the minimal additional empirical tests (highest acceptance lift per analysis hour)"
- "Please write a mock SMJ/ASQ review with scores"
- "Give me a results-to-claims matrix for possible experimental outcomes"

### Step 4: Convergence
Stop iterating when:
- Both sides agree on the core claims and their evidence requirements
- A concrete experiment plan is established
- The narrative structure is settled

### Step 5: Document Everything
Save the full interaction and conclusions to a review document in the project root:
- Round-by-round summary of criticisms and responses
- Final consensus on claims, narrative, and experiments
- Claims matrix (what claims are allowed under each possible outcome)
- Prioritized TODO list with estimated compute costs
- Paper outline if discussed

Update project memory/notes with key review conclusions.

## Theoretical Tension Types (use to diagnose weaknesses)

When evaluating or diagnosing theoretical contribution, classify the tension:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Scope condition violation | Theory assumes X; X doesn't hold here | Theory assumes strong IP protection; setting has none |
| Mechanism substitution | Same outcome, different mechanism | Entry increases not from lower barriers but from subsidy capture |
| Overlooked heterogeneity | Effect varies on unaccounted dimension | Effect differs by founder prior experience |
| Level-of-analysis gap | Theory at one level, dynamics at another | Firm-level theory, but interesting dynamics are market-level |
| Boundary condition | Mechanism works differently under condition | Network benefits reverse when network is too homogeneous |

If the paper's tension doesn't fit any of these cleanly, flag it — it may be underspecified.

## Journal Heuristics

Tailor feedback to the target journal:
- **Management Science:** Clean identification, precise mechanism. Less concerned with broad theoretical contribution.
- **Strategic Management Journal:** Strategic implications must be clear. What should firms do differently?
- **Organization Science:** Most theory-forward. Loves boundary conditions on established mechanisms.
- **Academy of Management Journal:** Balances theory and evidence. Framed as "what we didn't know before."
- **Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal:** Must advance entrepreneurship theory specifically.

## Writing Style

Before writing any memos or review documents, read [references/style.md](../references/style.md) for writing constraints.

## Key Rules

- ALWAYS use `config: {"model_reasoning_effort": "xhigh"}` for reviews
- Send comprehensive context in Round 1 — the external model cannot read your files
- Be honest about weaknesses — hiding them leads to worse feedback
- Push back on criticisms you disagree with, but accept valid ones
- Focus on ACTIONABLE feedback — "what analysis, reframing, or robustness check would fix this?"
- Document the threadId for potential future resumption
- The review document should be self-contained (readable without the conversation)

## Prompt Templates

### For initial review:
"I'm going to present a research paper for your critical review. Please act as a senior OT/Strategy reviewer for ASQ/AMR/SMJ/Organization Science..."

### For empirical robustness:
"Please design the minimal additional analyses or robustness checks that would most strengthen identification and address alternative explanations. Be specific about model specifications."

### For theoretical contribution:
"Please evaluate the theoretical contribution. Is the mechanism well-specified? Are boundary conditions clear? How does this advance theory beyond existing work? Suggest specific improvements to the theoretical argument."

### For paper structure:
"Please turn this into a concrete paper outline with section-by-section claims, theory development structure, and table/figure plan."

### For claims matrix:
"Please give me a results-to-claims matrix: what theoretical claim is supported under each possible pattern of empirical results?"

### For mock review:
"Please write a mock R&R review for SMJ/ASQ with: Summary, Strengths, Weaknesses, Questions for Authors, Recommendation (reject/R&R/accept), and What Would Move Toward Accept."
